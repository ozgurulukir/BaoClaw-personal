## What is BaoClaw?

BaoClaw is an open-source AI coding agent with a Rust core engine, persistent memory, local multi-client session sharing, a cron scheduler, and experimental self-improvement features. It runs as a single global daemon on your machine, managing multiple project sessions simultaneously. Your terminal, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Feishu can connect to this daemon — each routed to a project session by working directory.

BaoClaw can retain selected knowledge about you and your projects over time. Self-improvement features are heuristic and should be reviewed by the user.

## Key Features

### 🧠 Persistent Memory

- **Project-level memory** — each project directory gets its own `memory.jsonl`
- **Global memory** — cross-project facts, preferences, and decisions in `~/.baoclaw/`
- **Long-term recall** — memories are injected into the system prompt automatically
- **Manual control** — `/memory add`, `/memory list`, `/memory delete`

## Support Matrix

| Client/platform | Status    | Verified scope and limitations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Windows/WSL2    | WSL2 only | Run the Unix daemon inside WSL2; native Windows daemon IPC is not supported until named-pipe transport exists.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Security boundaries are defense-in-depth, not a guarantee that prompts or tool
inputs are safe. Review generated skills before promotion and do not provide
real credentials in examples or test fixtures.

### 📱 Multi-Client, Global Daemon

- **One daemon, all projects** — a single daemon process manages sessions for all your project directories
- **Per-project sessions** — each cwd gets its own session with independent history and memory
- **Multi-device access** — continue a task from another device when it can reach the daemon through a configured gateway
- **Real-time streaming** — all clients see tool calls and responses as they happen
- **No conflicts** — two CLI terminals in different directories use different sessions, no interference
- **Session persistence** — conversations survive daemon restarts, auto-resumed per project

### 🔄 Self-Evolution Engine (Experimental)

Inspired by [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)'s learning loop:

- **Trajectory recording** — every interaction is logged with tools used, outcomes, and timing
- **Skill auto-generation** — complex successful tasks are extracted as reusable skill candidates
- **Self-evaluation nudge** — every 15 tasks, the agent reflects on patterns and creates/improves skills
- **User ratings** — rate interactions as good/bad to build preference data
- **Training-data export** — export trajectories as JSONL in a format that can be adapted for DPO/RLHF fine-tuning
- **Personal evolution** — skills and trajectories are cross-project (`~/.baoclaw/evolution/`)
- **Evolve tool** — agent can propose, improve, and promote skills; review generated skills before relying on them

### ⏰ Cron Scheduler

- **Periodic tasks** — schedule prompts to run automatically inside the daemon
- **Flexible schedules** — `every 30m`, `every 2h`, `daily 09:00`, `weekly mon 09:00`
- **Result broadcast** — cron results pushed to all connected clients (CLI + Telegram)
- **Persistent** — jobs saved in `~/.baoclaw/cron.json`, survive daemon restarts
- **Agent tool access** — each job runs with the tools permitted by the daemon configuration

### 📄 Document Q&A

- **Upload files** — PDF, DOCX, and images via Telegram or CLI (`@file.pdf`)
- **Route A** — client-side text extraction (mammoth for DOCX, pdf-parse for PDF)
- **Route B** — native API document blocks (PDF sent directly to Claude/OpenAI)
- **Image understanding** — photos analyzed via multimodal API (both Anthropic and OpenAI compatible)
- **Tab completion** — `@` triggers file path completion in CLI

### 🗂️ Project-Scoped Everything

- **`/cd` command** — switch working directory at runtime, like changing projects
- **Auto-scaffold** — `.baoclaw/` directory with config files created automatically
- **Session per project** — each directory maps to its own persistent session file
- **Auto-resume** — reconnecting to a project automatically restores conversation history
- **Project instructions** — `BAOCLAW.md` loaded into system prompt per project
- **Memory isolation** — each project has its own memory store

### 🔁 Model Fallback

- **Automatic retry** — rate-limited requests retry with exponential backoff
- **Fallback chain** — configure multiple models; if one is rate-limited, fall back to the next
- **Transparent** — CLI shows model switches in real-time

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+C** during task → abort current task
- **Ctrl+C** when idle → hint to press again or `/quit`
- **Ctrl+C × 2** → disconnect from daemon
- **Tab** → autocomplete commands and file paths

### 🚀 v2.0 — Intelligence Layer (NEW)

Phase 2–4 additions that make BaoClaw smarter, safer, and faster:

#### 🔍 Cross-Session Search (#5)

- **SQLite + FTS5** full-text search across all past sessions
- Search by keyword, get ranked results with context snippets
- Find that solution you saw 3 weeks ago in seconds

#### ❄️ Frozen Snapshot Caching (#6)

- System prompt and tools list are built **once** and frozen for the entire session
- Maximizes Anthropic prompt cache hit rate — only the dynamic reminder changes per turn
- Reduces cost and latency on every API call

#### 👤 User Profile (#7)

- `~/.baoclaw/USER.md` — persistent user profile (name, language, coding style, tool preferences)
- Auto-loaded into system prompt for personalized responses
- Session stats merged automatically (total turns, cost, top tools)

#### 🔄 Skill Self-Improvement Loop (#8)

- **5-stage cycle**: Collect → Evaluate → Improve → Validate → Retire
- Scores skills on relevance rate, success rate, user rating, and staleness
- Auto-retires persistently poor skills, suggests improvements for mediocre ones
- Runs periodically to keep your skill set healthy

#### 📐 Adaptive Compact (#9)

- `AdaptiveCompactTracker` adjusts `keep_recent` heuristically from compression history
- If the user re-asks about pre-compact content → increase `keep_recent` (preserve more)
- If compression ratio is poor and no information loss → decrease `keep_recent` (compact harder)
- Range: 6–30 messages, auto-adjusted per session

#### 🏥 Tool Health Monitoring (#10)

- Tracks success/failure/timeout rates per tool in real time
- **3 statuses**: Healthy → Degraded (3 consecutive failures) → Disabled (6 failures)
- Degraded tools get warning messages in the system prompt
- Auto-recovers after 5 consecutive successes

#### 🎯 Intent Prediction (#11)

- Predicts user intent (coding, debugging, testing, refactoring, git, research…) from message keywords
- Heuristic transition matrix records what intent typically follows what (e.g., CodeWriting → Testing)
- High-confidence predictions trigger tool preloading hints in the system prompt

#### 🧮 Context Window Allocator (#12)

- Attention score = 0.5×relevance + 0.3×recency + 0.2×frequency
- Mandatory blocks (system prompt, tools) always included
- Optional blocks (memory, skills, search results) greedy-fill by score
- Budget exceeded → lowest-scoring blocks trimmed first

#### 🏖️ Sandbox Execution (#13)

- Three backends: **Bubblewrap** (Linux namespaces) → **Docker** (containers) → None (direct)
- Auto-detects best available backend at startup
- Configurable: read-only/read-write mounts, network isolation, memory/CPU limits, timeouts
- Wrap any command for sandboxed execution with a single `wrap_command()` call

#### 🛡️ Prompt Injection Detection (#14)

- **20 patterns** across 6 categories: instruction override, role hijack, data exfiltration, encoding tricks, hidden payloads, jailbreak
- Heuristic scoring with diminishing returns + multi-category boost
- Four severity levels: Clean → Suspicious → Dangerous → Critical
- `sanitize()` method redacts detected patterns with `[REDACTED]` placeholders

#### 🔐 Subagent Depth Policy (#15)

- Maximum nesting depth: 3 levels
- **Progressive tool restriction**: Depth 0 = all tools, Depth 1 = safe tools, Depth 2 = read-only, Depth 3 = minimal (FileRead + Bash only)
- Per-depth budgets: turns cap (100→30→15→5), cost cap ($10→$2→$0.50→$0.10)
- Exceeded budget → auto-terminate sub-agent

#### 📡 Streaming Tool Executor (#16)

- Real-time chunked output: Started → Progress → Stdout → Stderr → Completed → Error → Heartbeat
- `StreamWriter` / `StreamReader` pair via `tokio::sync::mpsc`
- Configurable timeout (5 min default), buffer size, max output (1MB default)
- Concurrent stdout/stderr reading with `tokio::select!`

### 🚀 v2.1 — Evolution Engine (NEW)

#### 📋 Workflow Template Engine (#17)

- **5 built-in templates**: `code_review`, `bug_fix`, `feature`, `docs`, `refactor`
- Trigger-based matching (`/review` → code_review template)
- Variable substitution with `${variable}` syntax and step output references `${stepN.output}`
- Conditional workflow steps with `condition` field
- Import/export templates as JSON for sharing
- Create custom templates with custom workflows and variables

#### 🌿 Git Integration (#18)

- **Branch Management**: create, list, switch, merge with name validation and protected branch detection
- **Commit Management**: stage files, commit with conventional format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`), amend, undo
- **Conflict Resolution**: detect conflicts from merge markers, resolve by taking ours/theirs
- **PR Management**: create pull requests, list by status, review, merge
- SSH and HTTPS credential management with host-based lookup

#### 🧭 Model Router (#19)

- **Intelligent routing**: select model by task type (code/completion/creative/analysis)
- **Cost-aware**: prefer cheaper models for simple tasks, route to premium models for complex work
- **Budget tracking**: set spending limits, track token usage, alert on threshold exceeded
- **Usage learning**: record route history, generate optimization suggestions based on usage patterns
- **Fallback chain**: automatic failover when primary model unavailable

#### 📊 Telemetry & Monitoring (#20)

- **Event collection**: record tool calls, model invocations, errors, session events
- **Trend analysis**: detect increasing/decreasing/stable patterns over time windows
- **Multi-format export**: JSON for programmatic use, CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- **Aggregated statistics**: per-tool usage counts, model distribution, error rates

#### 🔐 Permission Gate (#21)

- **Tool-level access control**: grant/revoke permissions per tool per session
- **Interactive prompts**: ask user for approval before executing sensitive operations
- **Permission caching**: cache decisions with configurable TTL to avoid prompt fatigue
- **Default-deny mode**: start with all tools denied, explicitly grant as needed

### 🖥️ CLI & TUI

- **18 new CLI commands** across 5 modules (`/template`, `/git`, `/model`, `/telemetry`, `/permission`)
- **Terminal UI (TUI)** built with Ink (React terminal framework):
  - Split-pane layout: message list + streaming output
  - Tool execution panel with live status
  - Syntax-highlighted code blocks
  - Keyboard shortcuts overlay (`Ctrl+H`)
- **Unix socket IPC**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over Unix domain sockets with NDJSON streaming
- Auto-discovers the fixed daemon socket first (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/baoclaw.sock` on Linux, `/tmp/baoclaw-sockets/baoclaw.sock` on macOS), then falls back to the cwd-hash socket

```

Key design: **one global daemon process manages all projects**. Each project directory gets its own session with independent conversation history and memory. Multiple CLI terminals and Telegram can connect simultaneously — each routed to the correct project session by its working directory.

## Internals: How the Engine Works

This section describes the five core mechanisms that make BaoClaw tick: **Memory**, **Context**, **Evolution**, **System Prompt**, and **Model Fallback**. All are implemented in the Rust core engine (`baoclaw-core/src/engine/`).

---

### 1. 🧠 Memory Mechanism

BaoClaw has two complementary memory layers: **Long-Term Memory** (cross-session facts/preferences) and **Session Memory** (rolling summary within a conversation).

#### Long-Term Memory (`memory.jsonl`)

| Aspect         | Detail                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**      | Two levels: global (`~/.baoclaw/memory.jsonl`) and project (`<project>/.baoclaw/memory.jsonl`) |
| **Categories** | `fact` (user told me X), `preference` (user prefers Y), `decision` (we decided Z)              |
| **Storage**    | Append-only JSONL, one JSON object per line                                                    |
| **Injection**  | Loaded at daemon startup → `build_prompt_fragment()` → appended to system prompt               |
| **Management** | `/memory add`, `/memory list`, `/memory delete`, `/memory clear`                               |

When the daemon starts, `MemoryStore::load()` reads both files, and `build_prompt_fragment()` generates a formatted block that becomes part of the `append_system_prompt` injected into every conversation turn.

#### Session Memory (`session_memory.rs`)

A per-session rolling summary that persists across the lifetime of a session — like meeting notes that get refined over time.

| Aspect               | Detail                                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage**          | `~/.baoclaw/sessions/{session_id}.memory.md`                |
| **First update**     | Triggers at **6 messages** (if summary is empty)            |
| **Refresh interval** | Every **10 messages** after the last update                 |
| **Thread safety**    | `std::sync::Mutex` — safe to share via `Arc<SessionMemory>` |
| **Persistence**      | Written to disk on every `update()` call                    |

**How it's used:**

1. **Free compaction** — `session_memory_compact()` uses the existing summary to replace old messages without any API call (keeps last 10 messages)
2. **Dynamic reminder** — injected into `<system-reminder>` in the user message each turn alongside git status
3. **Session resume** — when reconnecting, the old summary seeds the new session and triggers immediate compaction if > 50 messages

---

### 2. 📐 Context Mechanism

BaoClaw targets a 200K-token context window with a multi-layer compaction strategy and calibrated token counting.

#### Token Counting (`token_counter.rs`)

| Aspect                     | Detail                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context window**         | 200,000 tokens (default)                                                               |
| **Auto-compact threshold** | 70% = **140,000 tokens**                                                               |
| **Tokenizer**              | `cl100k_base` (GPT-4 tokenizer, ~5-10% over-count for Claude)                          |
| **Counting strategy**      | Calibrated from API response `usage.input_tokens` → anchored baseline + tiktoken delta |
| **Baseline persistence**   | `~/.baoclaw/sessions/{id}.baseline.json` — restores calibration after restart          |

**Budget levels (for 200K window):**

| Level        | Threshold    | Action                            |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Normal**   | < 140K       | Continue normally                 |
| **Compact**  | ≥ 140K (70%) | Pre-emptive compaction triggered  |
| **Warning**  | ≥ 147K       | Log warning                       |
| **Blocking** | ≥ 164K       | MUST compact before next API call |

#### 5-Level Compaction Hierarchy

Compaction is tried from cheapest to most expensive:

#### System Prompt Architecture

The system prompt is split into **static** (cached) and **dynamic** (per-turn) parts to maximize API prompt caching:

**Static part** (`build_system_prompt()`) — tagged with `cache_control: ephemeral`:

1. Core system prompt (or custom override)
2. Working directory + "show full content" instruction
3. Project instructions from `BAOCLAW.md`
4. Project rules from `.baoclaw/rules/*.md` (path-filtered against recent files)
5. Append system prompt = **skills** + **long-term memory** + **evolution prompt**

**Dynamic part** (`build_dynamic_reminder()`) — injected into the **last user message** as `<system-reminder>`:

1. Git status (branch, staged/modified/untracked files)
2. Session memory (rolling summary)

This split ensures the cached system prompt prefix stays stable across turns — only the dynamic reminder changes.

#### Session Resume Flow — Summary-First Three-Tier Strategy

```
1. find_latest_session_for_cwd(cwd)
     → FNV-1a hash of cwd → scan ~/.baoclaw/sessions/ for matching .jsonl
2. TranscriptWriter::load(session_id) → read all entries
3. SessionMemory::load(session_id) → check .memory.md for existing summary
4. Three-tier loading (10 min → < 5 sec):
   Tier 1 (best):   summary exists → load summary + last 200 entries only
   Tier 2 (small):  entries ≤ 400, no summary → safe to rebuild all
   Tier 3 (fallback): large session, no summary → last 200 entries + warning
5. engine.set_messages(messages)
6. engine.load_token_baseline(session_id)   // restore calibrated count
7. engine.seed_session_memory(&old_summary) // carry forward to new session
```

**Background summary generation** ensures Tier 1 is always available:

- First update at 6 messages, then every 10 messages (`tokio::spawn`, non-blocking)
- Session close heuristic fallback if background never ran
- Pre-query compact safety: >500 messages → `session_memory_compact` (free) or tail-trim (no API call)

### 3. 🔄 Evolution Mechanism

The experimental self-evolution engine records interaction data and can create or improve reusable skill candidates.

#### File Layout

```
~/.baoclaw/evolution/
├── trajectories.jsonl          # Every interaction record (append-only)
├── session_summaries.jsonl     # Structured summary per session close
├── skill_stats.json            # Per-skill usage tracking
├── pending_review.json         # Cross-session review → next session's prompt
├── pending_eval.json           # Self-evaluation nudge (one-shot, consumed)
└── candidates/
    └── {skill-name}.json       # Auto-extracted skill candidates
```

#### Key Thresholds

| Constant                   | Value        | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SKILL_CREATION_THRESHOLD` | 3 tool calls | Min complexity to auto-extract a skill candidate             |
| `SELF_EVAL_INTERVAL`       | 15 tasks     | Trigger self-evaluation nudge                                |
| Review trigger             | ≥ 2 turns    | Only generate `pending_review.json` if session had ≥ 2 turns |
| Candidate name max         | 60 chars     | Slugified from user prompt                                   |
| Topic truncation           | 200 chars    | Per topic in session summary                                 |

#### Evolution Lifecycle

**During interaction** (`record_trajectory`):

```
Every user interaction
    ├── Append trajectory to trajectories.jsonl
    ├── Increment task_count
    ├── IF tool_count ≥ 3 AND outcome = Completed:
    │     → Auto-extract SkillCandidate → save to candidates/{name}.json
    └── Every 15 tasks → write pending_eval.json (one-shot nudge)
```

**Session close** (`on_session_close`) — pure Rust, no LLM call:

```
Last client disconnects
    ├── Extract from message history:
    │     user_topics, tool_usage frequency, errors, skills_used
    ├── Write session_summaries.jsonl
    └── IF turn_count ≥ 2:
          Write pending_review.json (for next session's system prompt)
```

**System prompt injection** (`build_prompt_fragment`):

```
Start of new session
    ├── Check pending_review.json from previous session
    │     → Generate "Last Session Review" with self-improvement nudges
    ├── Check pending_eval.json
    │     → Generate "Self-Evaluation Nudge"
    ├── List pending skill candidates
    └── All injected into append_system_prompt → system prompt layer 5
```

**Skill promotion** (`promote_skill`):

```
Candidate approved → Move from candidates/ to ~/.baoclaw/skills/{name}.md
                     Remove candidate file
                     Skill loaded in all future sessions
```

**Training export** (`export_training_data`):

```
Read all trajectories → Create preference pairs
    Each pair: { prompt, response, rating: chosen/rejected/neutral }
    Output: ~/.baoclaw/evolution/training_export.jsonl
    Can be adapted for DPO/RLHF fine-tuning
```

### 4. 📋 System Prompt Construction

The system prompt is assembled in 5 ordered layers. The order matters for API prompt caching — stable layers come first:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 1: Core System Prompt                              │
│   • Default: "You are a helpful AI coding assistant."    │
│   • Override: custom_system_prompt in config             │
│   • Includes: "show full content" instruction            │
│   • Cache: cache_control = ephemeral                     │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 2: Working Directory                               │
│   • Current cwd path                                     │
│   • Instructs agent to output full file content          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 3: Project Instructions                            │
│   • From BAOCLAW.md (project root or .baoclaw/)          │
│   • Loaded once, cached across turns                     │
│   • Also loads .baoclaw/rules/*.md (path-filtered)       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 4: Append System Prompt                            │
│   • Skills (personal ~/.baoclaw/skills/ + project)       │
│   • Long-term memory (facts, preferences, decisions)     │
│   • Evolution prompt (pending reviews, skill candidates) │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Dynamic <system-reminder> (in last USER message)         │
│   • NOT in system prompt — preserves cache stability     │
│   • Git status (branch, changed files)                   │
│   • Session memory (rolling summary)                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this split?** The static layers (1-4) are tagged with `cache_control: ephemeral` so the API provider can cache the prefix. Only the dynamic `<system-reminder>` changes every turn — and it's injected into the user message, not the system prompt, so the system prompt cache stays warm.

**How skills & memory are loaded:**

1. At daemon startup: `load_skills_for_prompt(cwd)` → discovers all skill `.md` files
2. At daemon startup: `MemoryStore::load()` → reads global + project `memory.jsonl`
3. Combined via `build_append_prompt()` → becomes Layer 4
4. Evolution engine's `build_prompt_fragment()` adds pending reviews and skill candidates
5. All of this is computed once at startup and reused across turns

### 5. 🔁 Model Fallback Mechanism

When the primary model is unavailable or rate-limited, BaoClaw automatically falls back through a configurable chain of models.

#### Fallback Chain

```
Request with primary model
    │
    ▼
┌─ Rate Limited (429)? ─── Yes ──→ retry_count < max_retries?
│                                   │              │
│                                  Yes             No
│                                   │              │
│                                   ▼              ▼
│                              Retry with      Next model in chain?
│                              exponential       │           │
│                              backoff          Yes          No
│                                   │            │           │
│◀──────────────────────────────────┘            ▼           ▼
│                                          Fallback to    EXHAUSTED
│                                          next model     (all tried)
│                                          (reset counters)
│
├─ Server Error (5xx)? ──── Yes ──→ server_error_count < 3?
│                                   │              │
│                                  Yes             No
│                                   │              │
│                                   ▼              ▼
│                              Retry with      Fallback chain
│                              backoff         (same as above)
│                              (1s, 2s, 4s)
│
├─ Context Overflow? ────── Yes ──→ Try compaction first
│                                   │
│                                   ▼
│                              compact_messages() or reactive_compact()
│                                   │
│                              Retry with compacted context
│
└─ Success ◀────────────── Return response
```

#### Configuration

```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "fallback_models": ["claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"],
  "max_retries_per_model": 2
}
```

| Parameter                | Default                    | Description                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `model`                  | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Primary model (tried first every time) |
| `fallback_models`        | `[]`                       | Ordered list of fallback models        |
| `max_retries_per_model`  | `2`                        | Retries per model before falling back  |
| Server error max retries | `3`                        | Built-in limit for 5xx errors          |

#### Error Recovery Strategies

| Error Type                         | Strategy           | Parameters                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| IPC disconnect                     | Restart process    | Full daemon restart                |
| State sync failed                  | Full state sync    | Re-sync from scratch               |
| API rate limited (429)             | Retry with backoff | 3 attempts, 1s initial delay       |
| API server error (5xx)             | Retry with backoff | 3 attempts, exponential (1s→2s→4s) |
| API auth error                     | Fatal              | Cannot recover automatically       |
| API bad request (context overflow) | Auto-compact       | Compact → retry                    |
| MCP disconnect                     | Retry              | 5 attempts, 2s initial delay       |
| Tool timeout                       | Fatal              | Report to user                     |

**Key behaviors:**

- The fallback controller **resets** to the primary model for each new query (cross-turn stateless)
- **Exponential backoff** prevents hammering a rate-limited endpoint
- **Circuit breaker**: After 3 consecutive compaction failures, auto-compaction is disabled to avoid wasting API calls
- **5-minute timeout** per API call — on timeout, the user message is removed to keep history clean

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (1.96+) — [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
- **Node.js** (18+) — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- An LLM API key (Anthropic, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compatible provider)

### Linux / macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baohx/BaoClaw.git
cd BaoClaw
./install.sh
```

The installer builds the Rust core, installs Node.js dependencies, and creates the `baoclaw` launcher in `~/.local/bin/`.

### Windows (WSL2)

BaoClaw requires a Unix environment. On Windows, use WSL2:

```powershell
# Install WSL2 if not already installed
wsl --install

# Inside WSL2
git clone https://github.com/baohx/BaoClaw.git
cd BaoClaw
./install.sh
```

### Manual Setup

```bash
# 1. Build Rust core
cd baoclaw-core
cargo build --release
cd ..

# 2. Install CLI dependencies
cd ts-ipc
npm install
cd ..

# 3. Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# Or for OpenAI-compatible:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-provider.com/v1

# 4. Run
npx --prefix ts-ipc tsx ts-ipc/cli.ts
```

| Field                     | Type     | Default                    | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model`                   | string   | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Primary LLM model                                                         |
| `fallback_models`         | string[] | `[]`                       | Models to try when primary is rate-limited                                |
| `max_retries_per_model`   | number   | `2`                        | Retries before falling back to next model                                 |
| `api_type`                | string   | `"anthropic"`              | `"anthropic"` or `"openai"`                                               |
| `openai_base_url`         | string?  | `null`                     | Base URL for OpenAI-compatible API                                        |
| `telegram.token`          | string   | —                          | Telegram bot token from @BotFather                                        |
| `telegram.allowedChatIds` | number[] | `[]`                       | Allowed chat IDs (required; empty = reject all and refuse startup)        |
| `feishu.allowedChatIds`   | string[] | `[]`                       | Allowed Feishu chat IDs (required; empty = reject all and refuse startup) |

WhatsApp session credentials are stored under `~/.baoclaw/whatsapp-auth/`.
The directory is restricted to the owner (`0700`) and credential files to the
owner (`0600`) after each credentials update.

Environment variable overrides:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — API key (required)
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` — overrides `model` field
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` — overrides `openai_base_url`
- `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` — for WebSearch tool

OpenAI-compatible example:

```json
{
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "api_type": "openai",
  "openai_base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
}
```

### `<project>/.baoclaw/BAOCLAW.md` — Project Instructions

Injected into the system prompt for every conversation in this project. Write anything the agent should know about your project.

```markdown
# My Project

This is a Python web app using FastAPI + SQLAlchemy.

## Conventions

- Use type hints everywhere
- Tests go in tests/ directory
- Use pytest for testing
- Database migrations with alembic

## Important Files

- src/main.py — app entry point
- src/models/ — SQLAlchemy models
- src/api/ — FastAPI routes
```

Also works as `BAOCLAW.md` in the project root (`.baoclaw/BAOCLAW.md` takes priority).

### `mcp.json` — MCP Server Configuration

Works at both user level (`~/.baoclaw/mcp.json`) and project level (`<project>/.baoclaw/mcp.json`). Project-level overrides user-level.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sqlite": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "./data.db"],
      "env": {},
      "disabled": false
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`<project>/.baoclaw/mcp.local.json` — same format, for local overrides that should be gitignored.

### `~/.baoclaw/cron.json` — Scheduled Tasks

Managed via `/cron` command. Do not edit manually while daemon is running.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "a1b2c3d4",
    "name": "Daily git summary",
    "prompt": "Summarize yesterday's git commits in this project",
    "schedule": "daily 09:00",
    "cwd": "/home/user/my-project",
    "enabled": true,
    "created_at": "2026-04-14T10:00:00Z",
    "last_run": "2026-04-14T09:00:15Z",
    "last_result": "3 commits: fixed login bug, added tests..."
  }
]
```

Schedule formats: `every 30m`, `every 2h`, `daily 09:00`, `weekly mon 09:00`

### `~/.baoclaw/skills/` and `<project>/.baoclaw/skills/` — Skills

Markdown files loaded into the system prompt. User-level skills apply to all projects; project-level skills apply only to that project.

```markdown
---
description: Code review checklist
created_by: evolution
version: 2
---

# Code Review

When asked to review code:

1. Check for security issues (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
2. Check error handling (are errors caught and logged?)
3. Check naming conventions
4. Suggest performance improvements
5. Output as a checklist with ✅/❌
```

Skills can be created manually or auto-generated by the Evolution Engine.

### `~/.baoclaw/evolution/trajectories.jsonl` — Interaction Trajectories

Auto-recorded. Each line is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-14T10:30:00Z",
  "cwd": "/home/user/project",
  "user_prompt": "Fix the login bug",
  "assistant_actions": [
    {
      "tool_name": "Grep",
      "input_summary": "search for login",
      "output_summary": "found in auth.py",
      "is_error": false
    },
    {
      "tool_name": "FileEdit",
      "input_summary": "fix auth.py line 42",
      "output_summary": "edited",
      "is_error": false
    }
  ],
  "outcome": {
    "Completed": { "final_text_preview": "Fixed the login bug by..." }
  },
  "tool_count": 2,
  "duration_ms": 15000,
  "user_rating": "Good"
}
```

Export training data for later DPO/RLHF dataset preparation: ask the agent to `export training data` or use the Evolve tool.

## Telegram Setup

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Add token to `~/.baoclaw/config.json`
3. Start from CLI: `/telegram start`

Upload documents and images directly in Telegram chat — the bot extracts text and sends it to the AI.

## Cron Examples

```
/cron add "Daily git summary" "daily 09:00" Summarize yesterday's git commits
/cron add "Dep check" "weekly mon 10:00" Check for dependency security updates
/cron add "Evolution review" "every 2h" Review pending skill candidates and improve
/cron list
/cron toggle abc123
/cron remove abc123
```

Results are pushed to all connected clients (CLI shows ⏰ notification, Telegram receives a message).

### Training Data Export

```bash
# Inside BaoClaw, ask the agent:
> Export training data for fine-tuning

# Or use the Evolve tool directly:
# The agent calls Evolve(operation: "export_training")
# Output: ~/.baoclaw/evolution/training_export.jsonl
```

Each trajectory contains: prompt, tool actions, outcome, user rating (good/bad/neutral). Rated trajectories can be used as inputs when preparing preference pairs for DPO training.

## 🐾 BaoClaw — 带持久记忆和多客户端访问的 AI 编程助手

BaoClaw 是一个开源 AI 编程 Agent，基于 Rust 核心引擎，具备持久记忆、本地多客户端会话共享、定时任务和实验性自我改进功能。它以守护进程方式运行，同时连接终端、Telegram 和 WhatsApp。

和那些关掉窗口就失忆的 Agent 不同，BaoClaw 会随着使用不断积累对你和你项目的了解。用得越多，越好用。

## 核心特性

### 🧠 持久记忆

- 项目级记忆 — 每个项目目录独立的 `memory.jsonl`
- 全局记忆 — 跨项目的个人偏好和决策
- 自动注入 — 记忆自动加载到系统提示词中
- 手动管理 — `/memory add`、`/memory list`、`/memory delete`

### 📱 全局守护进程，多客户端

- 一个守护进程管所有项目 — 单个 daemon 进程管理所有项目目录的会话
- 项目级会话 — 每个工作目录有独立的会话历史和记忆
- 多设备访问 — 在配置好的 gateway 可访问 daemon 时，可从其他设备继续任务
- 实时流式输出 — 所有客户端同步看到工具调用和响应
- 无冲突 — 两个终端在不同目录工作，使用不同会话，互不干扰
- 会话持久化 — 对话在守护进程重启后自动恢复，按项目目录绑定

### 🔄 自我进化引擎（实验性）

参考 [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) 的学习循环：

- 轨迹记录 — 每次交互自动记录工具调用、结果和耗时
- Skill 自动生成 — 复杂的成功任务自动提取为可复用的 skill 候选
- 自我评估 — 每 15 个任务触发反思，创建或改进 skill
- 用户评价 — 对交互评分（good/bad），构建偏好数据
- 训练数据导出 — 导出可进一步整理为 DPO/RLHF 数据集的轨迹 JSONL
- 个人级进化 — skill 和轨迹跨项目积累（`~/.baoclaw/evolution/`）
- Evolve 工具 — Agent 可自主创建、改进和提升 skill

### ⏰ 定时任务

- 周期执行 — 在守护进程内自动运行预设的提示词
- 灵活调度 — `every 30m`、`every 2h`、`daily 09:00`、`weekly mon 09:00`
- 结果推送 — 定时任务结果推送到所有连接的客户端（终端 + Telegram）
- 持久化 — 任务保存在 `~/.baoclaw/cron.json`，守护进程重启后自动恢复
- 完整能力 — 每个任务都拥有完整的 Agent 工具访问权限

### 📄 文档问答

- 上传文件 — 通过 Telegram 或终端（`@file.pdf`）上传 PDF、DOCX、图片
- 文本提取 — DOCX 用 mammoth，PDF 用 pdf-parse
- 原生文档 — PDF 可直接发送给 Claude API
- 图片理解 — 支持 Anthropic 和 OpenAI 兼容 API 的多模态
- Tab 补全 — 终端中输入 `@` 后按 Tab 自动补全文件路径

### 🗂️ 项目级隔离

- `/cd` 命令 — 运行时切换工作目录，相当于切换项目
- 自动初始化 — 新目录自动创建 `.baoclaw/` 配置骨架
- 项目绑定会话 — 每个目录对应独立的持久化会话文件
- 自动恢复 — 重连时自动恢复项目的对话历史
- 项目指令 — `BAOCLAW.md` 按项目加载到系统提示词
- 记忆隔离 — 每个项目有独立的记忆存储

### 🛠️ 内置工具

Bash、文件读写编辑、Grep、Glob、Web 搜索、Web 抓取、记忆管理、子 Agent、自我进化、Todo、Notebook 编辑、项目笔记、工具搜索等。

### 🔌 可扩展

- MCP 协议 — 连接外部 MCP 服务器获取更多工具
- Skills — Markdown 格式的技能文件（个人级 + 项目级）
- 插件系统 — 目录式插件，包含工具、技能和 MCP 配置
- 200+ 模型 — Anthropic 原生 + 任意 OpenAI 兼容 API

### 🔁 模型降级

- 自动重试 — 限流时指数退避重试
- 降级链 — 配置多个模型，限流时自动切换
- 透明提示 — 终端实时显示模型切换

### ⌨️ 快捷键

- `Ctrl+C`（任务中）→ 中止当前任务
- `Ctrl+C`（空闲时）→ 提示再按一次退出
- `Ctrl+C × 2` → 断开连接
- `Tab` → 自动补全命令和文件路径

- **默认拒绝模式**：初始全部工具拒绝，按需显式授权

### 🖥️ CLI 和 TUI

- **18 个新 CLI 命令**，覆盖 5 个模块（`/template`、`/git`、`/model`、`/telemetry`、`/permission`）
- **终端 UI（TUI）**，基于 Ink（React 终端框架）构建：
  - 分栏布局：消息列表 + 流式输出
  - 工具执行面板，实时状态显示
  - 语法高亮代码块
  - 快捷键帮助面板（`Ctrl+H`）
- **Unix socket IPC**：基于 Unix 域套接字的 JSON-RPC 2.0 + NDJSON 流
- 自动发现 daemon socket：优先使用固定 socket（Linux 为 `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/baoclaw.sock`，macOS 为 `/tmp/baoclaw-sockets/baoclaw.sock`），再回退到 cwd-hash socket

## 内部机制：引擎工作原理

本节描述 BaoClaw 的五个核心机制：**记忆**、**上下文**、**进化**、**系统提示词**和**模型退回**。全部在 Rust 核心引擎（`baoclaw-core/src/engine/`）中实现。

---

### 1. 🧠 记忆机制

BaoClaw 有两个互补的记忆层：**长期记忆**（跨会话的事实/偏好）和**会话记忆**（对话内的滚动摘要）。

#### 长期记忆 (`memory.jsonl`)

| 方面         | 细节                                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **作用域**   | 两级：全局（`~/.baoclaw/memory.jsonl`）和项目级（`<项目>/.baoclaw/memory.jsonl`） |
| **分类**     | `fact`（用户告知的事实）、`preference`（用户偏好）、`decision`（决策记录）        |
| **存储**     | 追加写入 JSONL，每行一个 JSON 对象                                                |
| **注入方式** | 守护进程启动时加载 → `build_prompt_fragment()` → 追加到系统提示词                 |
| **管理命令** | `/memory add`、`/memory list`、`/memory delete`、`/memory clear`                  |

守护进程启动时，`MemoryStore::load()` 读取两个文件，`build_prompt_fragment()` 生成格式化文本块，成为每次对话都注入的 `append_system_prompt` 的一部分。

#### 会话记忆 (`session_memory.rs`)

每个会话的滚动摘要，在会话生命周期内持续精炼 —— 就像不断完善的会议纪要。

| 方面         | 细节                                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **存储位置** | `~/.baoclaw/sessions/{session_id}.memory.md`              |
| **首次更新** | **4 条消息**时触发（如果摘要是空的）                      |
| **刷新间隔** | 每隔 **10 条消息**更新一次                                |
| **线程安全** | `std::sync::Mutex` — 可通过 `Arc<SessionMemory>` 安全共享 |
| **持久化**   | 每次 `update()` 调用都立即写入磁盘                        |

**用途：**

1. **免费压缩** — `session_memory_compact()` 用已有摘要替换旧消息，无需 API 调用（保留最近 10 条）
2. **动态提醒** — 每轮注入到用户消息的 `<system-reminder>` 中，与 git 状态并列
3. **会话恢复** — 重连时，旧摘要种子到新会话，超过 50 条消息时立即触发压缩

---

### 2. 📐 上下文机制

BaoClaw 以 200K token 上下文窗口为目标，采用多层压缩策略和校准后的 token 计数。

#### Token 计数 (`token_counter.rs`)

| 方面             | 细节                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **上下文窗口**   | 200,000 tokens（默认）                                             |
| **自动压缩阈值** | 70% = **140,000 tokens**                                           |
| **分词器**       | `cl100k_base`（GPT-4 分词器，对 Claude 约多算 5-10%）              |
| **计数策略**     | 从 API 响应的 `usage.input_tokens` 校准 → 锚定基线 + tiktoken 增量 |
| **基线持久化**   | `~/.baoclaw/sessions/{id}.baseline.json` — 重启后恢复校准值        |

**预算等级（200K 窗口）：**

| 等级         | 阈值         | 行为                        |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Normal**   | < 140K       | 正常运行                    |
| **Compact**  | ≥ 140K (70%) | 触发预防性压缩              |
| **Warning**  | ≥ 147K       | 记录警告日志                |
| **Blocking** | ≥ 164K       | 必须在下一次 API 调用前压缩 |

#### 5 级压缩层次

从代价最低到最高依次尝试：

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 第 1 级: micro_compact  (免费，每轮执行)                         │
│   • 清除 > 500 字符 且 > 60 分钟的 tool_result 内容             │
│   • 跳过最近 4 条消息（当前轮次）                                 │
│   • 替换文本: "[Old tool result cleared — N chars]"              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 第 2 级: session_memory_compact  (免费，无需 API)                │
│   • 使用已有的 SessionMemory 滚动摘要                           │
│   • 保留最近 10 条消息，前置 CompactBoundary                    │

│   • 保留最近 10 条消息，通过 API 摘要旧消息                     │
│   • 缓存安全分叉: 复用系统提示词 + 旧消息作为 API 消息           │
│     → 在提供商侧复用缓存前缀                                    │
│   • 摘要输入截断到 60,000 字符（约 15K tokens）                  │

│   • 用压缩后的上下文重试查询                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 会话恢复流程 —— 摘要优先三层策略

```
1. find_latest_session_for_cwd(cwd)
     → 对 cwd 做 FNV-1a 哈希 → 扫描 ~/.baoclaw/sessions/ 匹配的 .jsonl
2. TranscriptWriter::load(session_id) → 读取所有条目
3. SessionMemory::load(session_id) → 检查 .memory.md 是否有预写摘要
4. 三层加载策略（10 分钟 → < 5 秒）:
   Tier 1（最佳）: 有摘要 → 只加载摘要 + 最近 200 条 entries
   Tier 2（小会话）: entries ≤ 400，无摘要 → 安全 rebuild 全部
   Tier 3（兜底）: 大会话无摘要 → 只取最后 200 条 + 警告消息
5. engine.set_messages(messages)
6. engine.load_token_baseline(session_id)   // 恢复校准计数
7. engine.seed_session_memory(&old_summary) // 继承摘要到新 session
```

**后台摘要生成**确保 Tier 1 始终可用：

- 首次在 6 条消息后更新，之后每 10 条消息更新一次（`tokio::spawn`，非阻塞）
- Session 关闭时 heuristic 兜底（如果后台更新从未触发）
- Pre-query compact 安全策略：>500 条消息 → `session_memory_compact`（免费）或 tail-trim（无 API 调用）

---

### 3. 🔄 进化机制

实验性自我进化引擎记录交互数据，并可创建或改进可复用的技能候选。

#### 文件布局

```
~/.baoclaw/evolution/
├── trajectories.jsonl          # 每次交互记录（追加写入）
├── session_summaries.jsonl     # 每次会话关闭的结构化摘要
├── skill_stats.json            # 每个技能的使用追踪
├── pending_review.json         # 跨会话审查 → 下次会话的提示词
├── pending_eval.json           # 自我评估提醒（一次性消费）
└── candidates/
    └── {skill-name}.json       # 自动提取的技能候选
```

#### 关键阈值

| 常量                       | 值           | 用途                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `SKILL_CREATION_THRESHOLD` | 3 次工具调用 | 自动提取技能候选的最低复杂度                  |
| `SELF_EVAL_INTERVAL`       | 15 个任务    | 触发自我评估提醒                              |
| 审查触发条件               | ≥ 2 轮       | 只有 ≥ 2 轮的会话才生成 `pending_review.json` |
| 候选名称最大长度           | 60 字符      | 从用户提示词 slug 化                          |
| 话题截断                   | 200 字符     | 会话摘要中每个话题                            |

#### 进化生命周期

**交互期间** (`record_trajectory`)：

```
每次用户交互
    ├── 追加轨迹到 trajectories.jsonl
    ├── 递增 task_count
    ├── 如果 tool_count ≥ 3 且结果 = Completed:
    │     → 自动提取 SkillCandidate → 保存到 candidates/{name}.json
    └── 每 15 个任务 → 写入 pending_eval.json（一次性提醒）
```

**会话关闭** (`on_session_close`) — 纯 Rust，无 LLM 调用：

```
最后一个客户端断开
    ├── 从消息历史提取:
    │     用户话题、工具使用频率、错误、已加载技能
    ├── 写入 session_summaries.jsonl
    └── 如果 turn_count ≥ 2:
          写入 pending_review.json（给下次会话的提示词）
```

**系统提示词注入** (`build_prompt_fragment`)：

```
新会话开始
    ├── 检查上次会话的 pending_review.json
    │     → 生成 "Last Session Review" 及自我改进建议
    ├── 检查 pending_eval.json
    │     → 生成 "Self-Evaluation Nudge"
    ├── 列出待处理的技能候选
    └── 全部注入到 append_system_prompt → 系统提示词第 5 层
```

**技能提升** (`promote_skill`)：

```
候选被批准 → 从 candidates/ 移到 ~/.baoclaw/skills/{name}.md
              删除候选文件
              技能在所有后续会话中加载
```

**训练数据导出** (`export_training_data`)：

```
读取所有轨迹 → 创建偏好对
    每对: { prompt, response, rating: chosen/rejected/neutral }
    输出: ~/.baoclaw/evolution/training_export.jsonl
    适用于 DPO/RLHF 微调
```

### 4. 📋 系统提示词构建

系统提示词由 5 个有序层组装。顺序对 API 提示词缓存至关重要 —— 稳定的层排在前面：

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 第 1 层: 核心系统提示词                                    │
│   • 默认: "You are a helpful AI coding assistant."       │
│   • 可覆盖: config 中的 custom_system_prompt              │
│   • 包含: "显示完整内容"指令                               │
│   • 缓存: cache_control = ephemeral                      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 第 2 层: 工作目录                                         │
│   • 当前 cwd 路径                                        │
│   • 指示 Agent 输出完整文件内容                            │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 第 3 层: 项目指令                                         │
│   • 来自 BAOCLAW.md（项目根目录或 .baoclaw/）              │
│   • 加载一次，跨轮次缓存                                   │
│   • 同时加载 .baoclaw/rules/*.md（按路径过滤）             │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 第 4 层: 追加系统提示词                                    │
│   • 技能（个人级 ~/.baoclaw/skills/ + 项目级）             │
│   • 长期记忆（事实、偏好、决策）                            │
│   • 进化提示词（待处理审查、技能候选）                       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 动态 <system-reminder>（在最后一条用户消息中）              │
│   • 不在系统提示词内 — 保持缓存稳定性                      │
│   • Git 状态（分支、修改文件）                              │
│   • 会话记忆（滚动摘要）                                   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**为什么这样拆分？** 静态层（1-4）标记了 `cache_control: ephemeral`，API 提供商可以缓存前缀。只有动态的 `<system-reminder>` 每轮变化 —— 它被注入到用户消息而非系统提示词中，因此系统提示词缓存保持有效。

**技能和记忆的加载流程：**

1. 守护进程启动时: `load_skills_for_prompt(cwd)` → 发现所有技能 `.md` 文件
2. 守护进程启动时: `MemoryStore::load()` → 读取全局 + 项目 `memory.jsonl`
3. 通过 `build_append_prompt()` 合并 → 成为第 4 层
4. 进化引擎的 `build_prompt_fragment()` 添加待处理审查和技能候选
5. 所有这些在启动时计算一次，跨轮次复用

### 5. 🔁 模型退回机制

当主要模型不可用或被限流时，BaoClaw 自动退回到可配置的模型链中的下一个模型。

#### 退回链

#### 配置

```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "fallback_models": ["claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"],
  "max_retries_per_model": 2
}
```

| 参数                    | 默认值                     | 说明                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `model`                 | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | 主要模型（每次优先尝试） |
| `fallback_models`       | `[]`                       | 有序的退回模型列表       |
| `max_retries_per_model` | `2`                        | 每个模型退回前的重试次数 |
| 服务器错误最大重试      | `3`                        | 5xx 错误的内置限制       |

#### 错误恢复策略

| 错误类型                   | 策略     | 参数                          |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| IPC 断连                   | 重启进程 | 完整守护进程重启              |
| 状态同步失败               | 全量同步 | 从头重新同步                  |
| API 限流 (429)             | 退避重试 | 3 次尝试，初始延迟 1s         |
| API 服务器错误 (5xx)       | 退避重试 | 3 次尝试，指数退避 (1s→2s→4s) |
| API 认证错误               | 致命     | 无法自动恢复                  |
| API 请求错误（上下文溢出） | 自动压缩 | 压缩 → 重试                   |
| MCP 断连                   | 重试     | 5 次尝试，初始延迟 2s         |
| 工具超时                   | 致命     | 报告给用户                    |

**关键行为：**

- 退回控制器对每个新查询**重置**到主要模型（跨轮次无状态）
- **指数退避**防止持续冲击限流端点
- **熔断器**：连续 3 次压缩失败后，禁用自动压缩以避免浪费 API 调用
- 每次 API 调用 **5 分钟超时** — 超时时移除用户消息以保持历史记录干净
